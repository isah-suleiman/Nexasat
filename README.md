### Business Challenge
NexaSat, a prominent player in the telecommunications industry, faces a critical dilemma: how to optimize marketing efforts and resource allocation. Their diverse customer base—ranging from occasional users to loyal enthusiasts—requires a tailored approach. As competition intensifies, NexaSat aims to maximize revenue from existing customers while identifying high-potential prospects. The challenge lies in pinpointing receptive customers and crafting personalized offers.

### Untapped Potential
NexaSat recognizes untapped opportunities within their customer base. Personalized offers and bundled services could boost Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). However, without a structured approach, their up-selling and cross-selling efforts yield suboptimal results.

### The Solution: CLV Segmentation
- What is CLV Segmentation?
  - A data-driven strategy categorizing customers based on long-term value.
  - Enables targeted marketing and tailored services.
  - Optimizes resource allocation and strengthens customer relationships.

- NexaSat's Goal
  - Unlock up-selling and cross-selling opportunities.
  - Design personalized offers for each segment.
  - Focus on high-opportunity segments for maximum ROI.
  - Strengthen loyalty in a competitive telecom landscape.

### Project Aim
Implement CLV segmentation to strategically boost revenue, enhance ARPU, and foster lasting customer satisfaction. NexaSat aims to secure a competitive edge by delivering tailored solutions aligned with customer preferences.

### Data Description
